# Demo 1 - Vanilla Drupal 7 module

**The Drupal core code is left out of this repository to put the focus fully on the important files.**

This branch shows the drupalcamp example module as it would be developed using plain Drupal 7 module development techniques. It contains a menu callback where a simple form will be rendered. The form has one validate function (length of the title field) and the submit function will show a message and return the user back to the homepage of the website.

We will use this module as a starting point.
