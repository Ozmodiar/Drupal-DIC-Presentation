# Dependency Injection Container integration in Drupal 7

This repository holds the example code for the "Develop a Drupal 7 project with Drupal 8 in mind" presentation I gave
at DrupalCamp Ghent 2014. In short, it shows how Composer, Symfony Dependency Injection Container and an Object-Oriented
way of programming can be implemented into Drupal 7 module development.

Please **check the different branches for the different demos** in the presentation:

- [Demo 1 - Vanilla Drupal 7 module](https://github.com/Ozmodiar/Drupal-DIC-Presentation/tree/demo-1-drupal7)
- [Demo 2 - Object-Oriented](https://github.com/Ozmodiar/Drupal-DIC-Presentation/tree/demo-2-OO)
- [Demo 3 - Dependency Injection](https://github.com/Ozmodiar/Drupal-DIC-Presentation/tree/demo-3-di)
- [Demo 4 - Symfony Dependency Injection Container](https://github.com/Ozmodiar/Drupal-DIC-Presentation/tree/demo-4-container)
