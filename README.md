# Dependency Injection Container integration in Drupal 7

This repository holds the example code for the "Develop a Drupal 7 project with Drupal 8 in mind" presentation I gave
at DrupalCamp Ghent 2014. In short, it shows how Composer, Symfony Dependency Injection Container and an Object-Oriented
way of programming can be implemented into Drupal 7 module development.

Please **check the different branches for the different demos** in the presentation.
